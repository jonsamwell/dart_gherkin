* Added the ability to have multiple example blocks with tags per scenario outline

## [1.1.8+5] - 26/10/2020

* Ensured world is disposed after last hooks are run

## [1.1.8+4] - 20/09/2020

## [1.1.8+2] - 17/07/2020

* Fixed issue with `JsonReporter` that would throw an error if an exception was logged before any features have run

## [1.1.7] - 04/03/2020
